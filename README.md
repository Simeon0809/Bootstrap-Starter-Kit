# Bootstrap Setup Project

This is a Bootstrap setup project that demonstrates three different ways to include Bootstrap in your web project. The project includes three Git branches, each with a different approach to setting up Bootstrap:

* Branch 1 - Include Bootstrap with Links: This branch provides a step-by-step guide on how to include Bootstrap in your project using links to the Bootstrap CDN. It is a simple and   straightforward approach that doesn't require any downloads or installations.

* Branch 2 - Include Bootstrap with Local Files: This branch provides a guide on how to include Bootstrap in your project using locally downloaded files. This approach is useful if you want to have more control over your files or if you are working in an offline environment.

* Branch 3 - Bootstrap with SASS: This branch provides the full open-source code for Bootstrap files, including SASS. SASS is a powerful preprocessor for CSS that makes it easier to write and maintain CSS code. Using SASS with Bootstrap allows you to customize the framework to suit your project's needs.

In each branch, you will find a README file with detailed instructions on how to set up Bootstrap in your project. We hope that this project will help you to get started with Bootstrap quickly and efficiently. Happy coding!
